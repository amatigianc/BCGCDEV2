    <description>I know that &quot;Delinquent&quot; is misspelled here. This is just the latest entry in the book of sin that has been started for the Fusion project. Instead of correcting the typo, we&#39;re just making sure that it&#39;s wrong in both places.  Another part of me has died today, and it&#39;s not even 9 am.</description>
